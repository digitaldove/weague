## Deployment

`pnpm build` Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.  
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
